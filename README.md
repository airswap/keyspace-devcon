# KeySpace Devcon5 Demo

KeySpace is a Trustless PGP implementation that utilizes Ethereum and IPFS. 

This demo is a react application that allows you to set up keyspace with metamask or a temporary wallet, and then utilizes IPFS PubSub messaging for encrypted peer-2-peer communication.

## Running it yourself

This project is bootstrapped with create-react-app, so after cloning, just run

```
yarn && yarn start
```

And you should be good to go. js-ipfs has some issues with node versions lower than v10.0.0 so a version higher than that is recommended.
